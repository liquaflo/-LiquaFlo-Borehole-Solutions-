## Understanding the New Regulatory Pressure

Municipal oversight in Johannesburg has increased due to unauthorised drilling and infrastructure damage in sensitive zones. This has created confusion among residents trying to install boreholes responsibly.

LiquaFlo has seen a rise in clients asking for clarity around drilling permits, consent forms, and SABS compliance. The goal is simple: help every client comply with the legal framework ✔ ensure safe drilling ✔ and prevent costly mistakes.

## Why Boreholes Still Matter in 2025

Water cuts and rising municipal tariffs are driving homeowners and businesses toward off-grid water independence. Suburbs like Alberton, Glenvista, and Turffontein have seen sharp increases in demand for borehole drilling and water purification systems.

A professionally designed system offers:

✔ Reduced dependence on municipal supply  
✔ Lower long-term utility bills  
✔ Access to underutilised groundwater  
✔ Cleaner, safer water through filtration and purification  
✔ Better sustainability through solar-powered pump options  

Groundwater remains one of South Africa’s most reliable resources when systems are installed correctly and within regulations.

## The Importance of SABS-Compliant Drilling

Responsible drilling is not optional under the new enforcement climate. All drilling must follow the SABS SANS 10299-1:2003 standard, ensuring that boreholes are safely constructed, documented, and environmentally responsible.

LiquaFlo ensures compliance by subcontracting drilling to certified partners who follow:

✔ Correct casing and sealing standards  
✔ Proper geological surveying  
✔ Safe drilling depths  
✔ Full traceable documentation  
✔ Proven water testing protocols  

This protects the homeowner from legal risk, prevents groundwater contamination, and ensures long-term system reliability.

## The Risks of Choosing a Non-Compliant Contractor

Many residents are attracted to cheap drilling deals advertised online. However, non-compliant contractors are responsible for most of the recent municipal crackdowns.

Warning signs include:

✔ No SABS or SANS compliance  
✔ Cash-only quotes  
✔ No itemised bill  
✔ No geological survey  
✔ No pressure or purification plan  
✔ No after-service support  

These shortcuts lead to expensive repairs, dry boreholes, electrical failures, and legal issues.

✔ Municipal paperwork  
✔ Consent forms  
✔ Site assessments  
✔ System design  
✔ Compliance documentation

This ensures every installation is legal, efficient, and durable.

## Looking Ahead: Faster Approvals and Better Water Security

Industry partners, including the Borehole Water Association (BWA), are working with Johannesburg authorities to streamline approval times. While some applications currently face delays of up to eight weeks, residents are encouraged to begin the process early.

LiquaFlo recommends starting applications ahead of the winter dry season to avoid operational downtime and water shortages.

## Final Advice for Johannesburg Residents

If you're planning to drill or upgrade a borehole system, focus on three essentials:

✔ Compliance with SABS SANS 10299-1:2003  
✔ A fully engineered water system, not just drilling  
✔ A partner who prioritises sustainability and responsible groundwater use  

With rising water tariffs and ongoing supply interruptions, professionally installed borehole systems are becoming one of the most valuable long-term investments for homes, farms, and businesses.
